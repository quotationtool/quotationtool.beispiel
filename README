Conversion from Ruhr-Uni
------------------------

For converting the zodb from the 2009 version which runs at Ruhr-Uni
Bochum do the folling steps.

1) cd to ../bspconversion and put DATA.fs in var/

2) run bin/pack and bin/doConversion

3) cp DATA.fs into quotationtool.beispiel/var/filestorage

4) run the instance by bin/paster serve debug.ini

The doConversion script does:

- it creates a new root folder object based on zope.site.folder.Folder

- it creates and registers some utilities in its site manager

- it copies the existing quotationtool app (IQuotationtoolSite object)
  to this new root folder

- it stores the new root folder in the database's root under the name
  'Application'
